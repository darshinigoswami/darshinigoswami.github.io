👋    Hello world! I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca). One of the classes I've enjoyed the most is Engineering Design (MEC 325) where I led my team from project conceptualization to evaluation to innovate hospital patient lifts. Read more about my project [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0FXEsOLpZK0MNxRrrf5QQXOV1cyYtP4aKf-DwHzdM8/edit).

I am passionate about developing and implementing sustainable technologies into everyday practices. 

Through previous internships at [Suncor](https://www.suncor.com/) and [IBM-Intelense](https://www.intelense.com/), I have developed a diverse skillset for creating user-first, meaningful and impactful projects. Check out my [<ins>resume</ins>](/Resume.pdf) for more details on the projects I have lead. 

In my free time, I love to hike, get bubble tea, and hit the gym for some kick-boxing. I also love getting involved in Design Teams at Ryerson to find new projects to learn from. 
I'm always up for a good challenge!
